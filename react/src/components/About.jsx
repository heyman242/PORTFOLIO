          I'm Himanshu Bobade, originally from Chandrapur, Maharashtra. I have a
          educational background in Mechanical Engineering, having completed my
          Bachelor's degree at the prestigious National Institute of Technology
          (NIT), Raipur.

          After graduating, I embarked on a new journey into the world of
          software engineering. I joined Algouniversity, where I honed my
          problem-solving skills through in-depth learning of data structures
          and algorithms. Additionally, I delved into web development using the
          MERN Stack and Django, crafting scalable projects under the mentorship
          of Senior Engineers from renowned companies such as Google, Apple,
          Grab Singapore, and Microsoft.

          Currently, I am a Software Engineer Trainee at ROXLIER SYSTEMS, Pune,
          where I joined in the first week of September. In this role, I'm
          actively engaged in learning and applying cutting-edge technologies.
          My current tech-stack includes Loopback 4, TypeScript, and Amazon Web
          Services (AWS).
